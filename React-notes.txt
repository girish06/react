babel concepts
jsx concepts

props concepts
   it can be used to get the dynamic content as a argument.

ReactDom exposes the object. 
reactDom has render method, which can render the javascript function as component to the real DOM
In render method we can render a js function as a html element

In react class will be named as className
In react we use single open close curly braces to print the dyanmic value in the variable.

huge ecosystem, bigger community,high performance.

Two kinds of applications

Single page application.

  Every component will be react component
  only one reactDOM.render method 
  only one root component

multipage application.
  multiple pages ,content is rendered on server.
  entire page is not in react control.
  reactDOM.render method will be called per widget.
